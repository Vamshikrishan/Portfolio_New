## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are required for a static site. For a better development experience, you may want:

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime, Vim)
- Optional: Node.js and npm (if you add build tooling)

### Run Locally

Option A — Quick (no server):
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Vamshikrishan/Portfolio_New.git
2. Open the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

Option B — Recommended (simple local server):
1. If you have Python installed, run:
   - Python 3.x:
     python -m http.server 8000
   - Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
2. Or use VS Code Live Server extension or any static file server.

---

## Project Structure

A typical project layout (update this to match your repository):

- index.html — landing/home page
- /assets
  - /css — stylesheets
  - /js — JavaScript files
  - /images — images and screenshots
- /projects — optional project detail pages
- README.md — this file

Please update this section to reflect the actual file layout in your repo.

---

## Deployment

This site is well-suited for static hosting. Popular options:

- GitHub Pages
  - Push branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and enable Pages in repository settings.
- Netlify — connect the repo and deploy with automatic builds.
- Vercel — connect the repo for instant deployments.

If you use build tooling (e.g., npm + build step), set the build command and publish folder in your hosting provider settings (for example, `dist/`).

---

## Customizing

To personalize the portfolio:
- Replace placeholder text (name, bio, experience).
- Add your projects/screenshots to the projects section.
- Update colors, fonts, and styles in CSS.
- Hook up a real contact form or use a mailto: / form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
